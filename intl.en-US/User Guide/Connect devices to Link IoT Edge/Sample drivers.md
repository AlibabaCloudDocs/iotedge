# Sample drivers

This topic describes two sample drivers provided by Link IoT Edge: Light and LightSensor. It also provides details about how to use these drivers.

The Light driver is a driver that is designed for smart lamps. You can use the Light driver to simulate and control smart lamps.

The LightSensor driver is a driver that is designed for light sensors. You can use this driver to simulate light sensors. This driver allows the simulated light sensors to repeat light intensity data based on a specified cycle.

## Method of using sample drivers

1.  Assign the Light driver and a sub-device to an edge instance.

    1.  On the **Instance Details** page, click the Devices & Drivers tab, and click the `+` icon on the right side of **All Drivers**. Then, select **Official Drivers** from the drop-down list, and assign the Light driver to the edge instance.

        ![Assign the Light driver to an edge instance](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6922378851/p37907.png)

    2.  Optional. Configure the driver. To do this, click the Light driver, and click **Driver Configurations** next to **Devices**. After you complete the configuration, click **OK**.

        In this example, you do not need to configure the driver.

        ![Configure the sample driver](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6922378851/p48030.png)

        |Parameter|Description|
        |---------|-----------|
        |Configuration Format|The configuration method. Valid values:         -   Key-value Configuration
        -   JSON Format
        -   Configuration File |
        |Configuration Format \(Key-value Configuration\)|If you select **Key-value Configuration**, click **Add Configuration** on the Driver Configurations page. Then, specify the Configuration Name, Value, and Description parameters. You can add a maximum of 100 key-value pairs. |
        |Configuration Format \(JSON Format\)|If you select **JSON Format**, enter the JSON-formatted data to configure the driver. The data size cannot exceed 1 KB. Link IoT Edge automatically verifies the format. If the format is invalid, modify the data as prompted.|
        |Configuration Format \(Configuration File\)|If you select **Configuration File**, edit a local configuration file and upload it to the console.|

    3.  Optional. On the right side of Devices, click **Container Configurations**. On the page that appears, configure the container for the driver. After you complete the configuration, click **Save**.

        **Note:** You can specify Container Configurations only when the **Instance Type** parameter is set to Pro Edition.

        |Parameter|Description|
        |---------|-----------|
        |Host Mode|Specifies whether to isolate the container network from the host network. The valid values are described as follows:         -   Yes: This value indicates that the container network is the same as the host network.
        -   No: This value indicates that the container network is isolated from the host network. If you select this option, you must configure the Network Port Mapping settings. |
        |Network Port Mapping|The mappings between host network ports and container network ports. This parameter is available only whenHost Mode is set to No. The network where the function runs is isolated from the host network. You can map the listening port of the function in the container to a host network port. This allows client programs on various hosts to access the services that are provided by the function. You can specify a maximum of 10 entries. For example, the `fc-http-server` function runs in a host container, and provides services by using socket port 80. The client programs on other hosts cannot access the `fc-http-server` function by accessing port 80 on the current host. To enable the client programs on other hosts to access the `fc-http-server` function, you must map the network port \(port 80\) in the container where the function runs to a host network port, such as port 8080. Then, the client programs on other hosts can access the `IP address:port 8080` in the host network, and use the services provided by the `fc-http-server` function. |
        |Privilege Mode|Specifies whether to enable the privilege mode. Root users of containers can access host services only as general users. If you want to change the system time or run the mount command in containers, you must be granted the required root permissions. In this scenario, you must enable the privilege mode for the containers.

 **Note:** If you enable the privilege mode, applications and programs in the containers are granted the host root permissions, and all the host devices are mapped to the containers. Therefore, you do not need to configure the Device Mapping settings. |
        |Device Mapping|The device mappings. This parameter is available only when you select No for Privilege Mode. The network where the device management system resides is isolated from the host network. To enable a function to access a host device such as a serial interface, you must map the device to the container where the function runs. You can specify a maximum of 10 entries.|
        |Volume Mapping|The volume mappings. The network where the file system resides is isolated from the host network. To enable a function to access a host file, you must map the file to the container where the function runs. You can specify a maximum of 10 entries.|

    4.  In the Devices section, click **Assign Sub-device**. In the Light driver settings, assign a device to the edge instance.

        ![Assign a sub-device to the sample driver](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6922378851/p48037.png)
