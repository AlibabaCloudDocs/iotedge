# Overview

IoT Platform provides API operations that are used to manage products, devices, groups, topics, rules, and device shadows. It also provides API operations that are used to send messages. To send an IoT Platform API request, you must use IoT Platform SDKs to send a GET or POST request over HTTPS or HTTP to the IoT Platform endpoint. You must add the request parameters that correspond to the API operation being called. IoT Platform handles the request and returns a result.

For more information about how to call an API operation, see the following topics:

-   [Make API requests](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide (Cloud)/API reference/Make API requests.md)
-   [Common parameters](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide (Cloud)/API reference/Common parameters.md)
-   [Error codes](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide (Cloud)/API reference/Error codes.md)

To ensure the security of your Alibaba Cloud account, we recommend that you call API operations as a RAM user.

For information about how to grant a RAM user permissions to call the required API operations, see [API permissions](/intl.en-US/User Accounts/RAM authorization/Resource Access Management (RAM)/API permissions.md).
